Welcome Teachers!

Are you looking for resources to teach your students how to protect themselves while advocating for change in their communities? Look no further! We offer a six-session "Security for Changemakers" course that equips students with the skills they need to stay safe while campaigning for issues they care about, such as the construction of a new local climbing wall, animal rights, or cycling lanes.

Our course is specifically designed to address the unique challenges faced by activists, protestors, and advocates. We cover topics such as digital security, physical safety, and legal considerations, all in the context of advocating for positive change.

Our course materials include lesson plans, handouts, and interactive activities, all of which are designed to engage your students and help them learn in a fun and effective way. Our resources are targeted at 16-18 year olds but can be tailored to meet the specific needs of your classroom.
