Title : "Tightrope: security training for changemakers"
---

![The Tightrope Logo](/assets/logo.png)


Some of you are going to take action for what you believe in. That might be climate change, litter in a local park, animal testing, more cycle lanes, or the need for a local climbing wall.   The problem is that this can expose you to all sorts of threats from people who might disagree with you. The dangers of digital life include doxing, swatting,  stalking, harassment, and abuse.

Our project works with young people who are interested in making changes. We help you both to:

* identify safe, reasonable, and useful steps to make changes, campaign, and find information. 
* identify risks, assess them, and take appropriate counter-measures. You'll be thinking about the security trade-offs at individual, group, organisation, and cause level. 

We offer 6-8 face-to-face sessions entirely for free, delivered by a combination of charity campaigners and cyber security experts.
